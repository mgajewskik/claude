Use gemini to review staged changes I have made on this branch and which are not yet commited.
Check for any code architecture inconsitencies, bugs, vulnerabilites and performance issues.
Suggest improvements if you see any.
Make sure that tests are passing and if there are none, then test the implementation manually.
Review the gemini's review and add your insights if you have any.
